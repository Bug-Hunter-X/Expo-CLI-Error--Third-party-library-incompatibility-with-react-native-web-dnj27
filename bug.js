This error typically occurs when using Expo's `react-native-web` support with a third-party library that isn't fully compatible.  The library might be trying to access native modules or functionalities that aren't available in a web environment. For instance, libraries relying on native camera access, geolocation, etc., will fail when running on web. The error message might be quite generic, sometimes showing an error related to missing modules or a failure during the `require` statement. Specific error messages can vary widely depending on the conflicting library.

**Example scenario (Illustrative):**
Let's imagine a library that utilizes the native camera directly:

```javascript
// Within a third-party library
const { takePictureAsync } = require('expo-camera');
// ... other code ...
```

If this library is used in an Expo app intended for web deployment, the `require` call for `expo-camera` will fail on the web because there's no native camera available.  Expo's `react-native-web` can't simulate this functionality.
