# Expo CLI Error: Third-party library incompatibility with react-native-web

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered in Expo CLI when utilizing third-party libraries that lack compatibility with `react-native-web`. The error usually surfaces as missing modules or `require` statement failures during web deployment.

## Problem Description

Certain third-party libraries rely on native functionalities (e.g., camera, geolocation) unavailable in web environments. When such libraries are integrated into an Expo project configured for web support, they can cause unexpected errors due to incompatible module access.

## Solution

The primary solution involves identifying the problematic library and either:

1. **Finding a web-compatible alternative:** Search for alternative libraries designed to work within web browsers.  Many libraries provide web versions or alternative implementations.
2. **Conditional imports:** Use conditional logic to load different library implementations based on the environment (web or native).
3. **Implement features yourself or use mock functions:**  If an alternative isn't readily available, consider implementing the required functionality yourself or using mock functions during web development.

This approach ensures graceful fallback mechanisms and allows building cross-platform apps without breaking in web environments.
