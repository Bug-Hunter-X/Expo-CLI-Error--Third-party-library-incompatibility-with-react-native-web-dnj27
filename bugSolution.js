To address this issue, we should use conditional rendering to load different implementations based on the environment.  This example assumes the problematic library is named `some-native-library` and that we have a web-compatible alternative called `some-web-library`. 

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import React from 'react';
import { Platform } from 'react-native';

let MyComponent = null;

if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
  MyComponent = require('./some-web-library'); //Import web version
} else {
  MyComponent = require('./some-native-library'); // Import native version
}

export default function MyComponentWrapper() {
  return <MyComponent/>;
}
```

This approach allows the application to use the appropriate library version depending on whether it's running on a native environment or in a web browser.  Remember to install both the native and web-compatible libraries in your `package.json` file.
